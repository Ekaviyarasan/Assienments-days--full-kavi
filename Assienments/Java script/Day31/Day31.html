Define React in your own words

React is a JavaScript library used to build fast and interactive user interfaces by breaking the UI into reusable components and efficiently updating the web page when data changes.

Two advantages of React

Component-based architecture – UI is divided into reusable components, making code easier to manage and reuse.

Fast performance – React uses a Virtual DOM, which updates only the changed parts of the UI instead of reloading the whole page.


In Vite React → main.jsx

In Create React App (CRA) → index.js



<h1 className="title">Welcome</h1>


return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>React</p>
  </>
);



npm create vite@latest my-react-app





cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
